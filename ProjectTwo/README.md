> ProjectTwo

In a box bounded by [-1, 1], given m balloons(they cannot overlap) with variable radio r and position mu. And some tiny blocks are in the box at given position {d};balloons cannot overlap with these blocks. find the optimal value of r and mu which maximizes
sum r^2

>Solution

My Solution is the same as the first project, i use the enumeration to solve it, i computed every possible answer and compare them, then get the best result.

I think this algorithm is very wasting time on considering every solution, besides this, the companies won't test this kind of algorithm for it spends too much time
